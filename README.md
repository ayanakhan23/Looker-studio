App Insights Unlocked – Google Play Store Analysis 

Project Overview -
App Insights Unlocked is a data analytics case study focused on analyzing Google Play Store application data to uncover key factors that drive app success. This project was completed
entirely using Looker Studio, with the goal of transforming raw app data into meaningful, business-ready insights through interactive dashboards and visual storytelling.
The analysis helps stakeholders understand user behavior, app performance, and market trends to support data-driven decisions in app development, marketing, and monetization strategies.

Business Problem -
The company wanted to answer critical questions such as:
What factors contribute to high app ratings and installs?
Which app categories and genres perform best?
How do app size, pricing, and type (Free vs Paid) affect user engagement?
What user preferences can be inferred from ratings, reviews, and content ratings?

Dataset -
Source: Google Play Store dataset (Kaggle)
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps

Dataset Highlights -
The dataset contains information such as:
App name and category
User ratings and number of reviews
App size and number of installs
Free vs Paid apps and pricing
Content rating and genres

Data Preparation (Performed Before Visualization) -
Although the dashboard was built in Looker Studio, the following preprocessing logic was applied:
Handling missing values in Rating and Size
Converting Installs and Price into numerical formats
Removing duplicate app records
Standardizing category and genre names
Formatting Last Updated as a date field

Key Metrics Developed -
Average App Rating
Total Installs by Category

Tools Used :-
Looker Studio – Dashboard creation & visualization
Google Play Store Dataset – Data source

Business Impact -
